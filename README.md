Twitter Bootstrap for Visualforce
=================

## Support for Visualforce
This flavor of Bootstrap has been modified to play nice (or at least nicer) with Visualforce by including a higher level of specificity to the CSS. If you have any questions or issues, post them in the issues or do a pull request if you add/fix/change anything that might be useful for others.


## Getting Started

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/jairzh/bootstrap-sfdc.git`.


## Adding Bootstrap as a Static Resource
Create a zip archive of all the assets. In Salesforce, upload this zip file as a static resource. You can do so under **Setup > Develop > Static Resources**.



## Using Bootstrap in Visualforce
To include the assets in your visualforce page, please refer to [Delivering Static Resources with Visualforce](http://wiki.developerforce.com/page/Delivering_Static_Resources_with_Visualforce).

In order to make everything look neat, be sure to wrap all of your Bootstrap HTML markup in an div with an ID of `force`, as shown below.

```html
<div id="force">
    <!-- Bootstrap HTML markup here -->
</div>
```
